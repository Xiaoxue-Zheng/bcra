# BCRA - Breast Cancer Risk Assesment in Young Women

## Build Prerequisites
NB: It is recommended to use nvm for installing (and switching between) node versions

Below is a list of software we use in the running of the BCRA application.
The versions listed by each of them is recommended for successful building.
- node.js (10.16.3)
- PostGreSQL (13.1.0)

## Quality Assurance / Current Project Status
NB: This section is to be updated with every change that is made.

- Integration tests for the server application are incomplete and may fail due to race conditions as the database is not cleared in the background between tests. This is to be addressed as part of CLIN-1147.
- Unit tests for the questionnaire front end seem to be incomplete, or inadequately cover the whole solution. This is to be addressed as part of CLIN-1173.
- End-to-end tests for the questionnaire front end seem to be failing due to a CryptoJs failure. This is to be addressed as part of CLIN-1173.

## Database

### Configure Postgres for Local Development
Install postgres on your machine, check it is running, and create the database and user with the following commands:
```
psql -U postgres
create database bcra;
create user bcra with encrypted password 'bcra123';
grant all privileges on database bcra to bcra;
```

### Clearing the Database
```
psql -U postgres
drop database bcra;
create database bcra;
grant all privileges on database bcra to bcra;
\q
```

### Recreate Database
 * Clear the database (see above)
 * Copy .yo-rc.json and database-model.jdl to a new folder
 * `jhipster`
 * `jhipster import-jdl database-model.jdl`
 * copy to project: `/src/main/resources/config/liquibase/`

### Create Liquibase Changeset for Hibernate Changeset
 * Clear database
 * `mvnw` (creates liquibase DB)
 * Make hibernate changes
 * `mvnw compile`
 * `mvnw liquibase:diff`
 
 
## Application

The **application** project contains the back-end server, and the interface for all users except participants. It is generated by JHipster.

### Launch Local Build
Install packages: `npm install`

Build & run back-end: `mvnw`

Launch front-end: `npm start`

### Run Back-End Tests
`mvnw verify`

#### Run a Single Back-End Tests
`mvnw surefire:test -Dtest=ClassNameOfTest`

#### Run all Back-End Tests in a Package
`mvnw surefire:test -Dtest="uk.ac.herc.bcra.algorithm.**"`

### Run Front-End Tests
`npm test`

### Run Front-End E2E Tests
Navigate to the /application in two console windows.

In one window run `npm test`

In the other window run `npm run e2e`

### Build for Production
`mvnw -Pprod,war clean verify`

### Add New Entity to Model
`jhipster entity Question`

### Tyrercuzick process

When a risk assessment is completed, it is ran through our tyrercuzick process. This requires a directory structure to be set up.

Before the application is started, be sure that you have the following directory structure:

/home/tyrercuzick/input/
/home/tyrercuzick/output/

As well as this, make sure to place the tyrercuzick.exe application (which is found in the ./application directory) in the following directory:

/home/tyrercuzick/tyrercuzick.exe

If you are on an iOS system, then use the following directory structure for the tyrer cuzick files:

/usr/local/share/tyrercuzick/input/
/usr/local/share/tyrercuzick/output/
/usr/local/share/tyrercuzick/tyrercuzick.exe
 
## Questionnaire

The **questionniare** project contains the front-end for participants. It is generated by vue-cli.

### Logging in for development/testing/inspecting
If you want to login to the questionnaire interface:
1. Open the Admin Interface (localhost:8080) and import **Participant1111111111.csv**
2. Open the Participant Interface (localhost:3210) and register as this participant (NHS number: 1111111111 and DOB 11/11/1111)
3. Sign in with the chosen username/password


### Launch Local Build
Install packages: `npm install`

Launch front-end: `npm run serve`

### Build for Production

Build front-end: `npm run build`

<del>This will place a **.war** file in the **dist** folder.</del>

(The warfile plugin is temporarily deactivated, because it conflicts with Cypress end-to-end tests.

### Run Tests

#### Unit Tests
`npm run test:unit`

#### End-to-End Tests
0. Clear the database (see above) if there have been any model changes.
1. Launch back-end with `mvnw`(see above)
2. Open the Admin Interface (localhost:8080) and import **TestParticipantCsv.csv**
3. `npm run test:e2e`

To run end-to-end tests in a headless environment, use:

`npm run test:headless`

#### Test StudyId
A default study ID is created to test the new sign up functionality. 
This id is 'TST_1', and has a consent and risk assessment questionnaire automatically assigned.
