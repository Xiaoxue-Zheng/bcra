     <p>We know that women who have a strong family history of breast cancer are at increased risk themselves.
       There is already a system in England for GPs (general practitioners) to refer women with a strong family
       history of breast cancer directly into a family history clinic for assessment.
       If the risk of breast cancer is confirmed to be high, women can start breast screening early (aged 40) and be offered preventive treatments.
      </p>

     <h2>So what do we mean by a 'strong family history'?</h2>

     <p>When we talk about how closely related relatives are we use the term 'degrees'. Each degree refers to how closely related the relative is to you.
         So your mother, sister or children are all first degree as they are only one step away from you genetically. Your grandmother, aunt or niece are
        'second degree relatives' as they are two steps away. We also include half-sisters as second degree relatives.
      </p>

      <div class='p1'>
        <h2>The age at which relatives are affected by cancer is also important. If you have any of the following:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Your mother or sister had breast cancer when they were less than 60 years old OR</li>
          <li>One second degree relative with breast cancer when they were less than 40 years old OR</li>
          <li>Two or more first or second degree relatives affected by breast cancer at any age;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>then please ask your GP to refer you directly to the family history clinic and you don\'t need to continue with this study.</p>
      </div>

      <p>If you have a first degree relative affected by breast cancer at age 60 or above or a single second degree relative at age 40 or above
        we need to know more about your family tree to assess your own breast cancer risk more accurately.
