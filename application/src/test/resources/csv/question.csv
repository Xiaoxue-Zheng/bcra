26;SELF_PREMENOPAUSAL;RADIO;6;;;9;;Are you premenopausal?;What does premenopausal mean?;"<p>As this programme is for young women it is most likely that you are premenopausal. You can still be premenopausal without having regular periods for a number of reasons such as:<ol><li>Contraception such as the pill, implant or Mirena coil.</li><li>Being overweight or underweight can stop your periods but this is not the same as the menopause because a return to normal weight is likely to mean that your periods start working again. Menopause means that your ovaries have stopped working altogether.</li></ol><br>If you have been told that you are menopausal, for example after blood tests confirmed that your ovaries have stopped working or you have had both ovaries removed, please tell us at what age this was in the next question.</p>"

32;SELF_BREAST_BIOPSY;RADIO;9;;;9;;Have you ever had a breast biopsy?;What is a biopsy?;"<p>A biopsy is when a small amount of tissue is removed or a larger amount of tissue is removed by cutting pieces from the breast, or a lump is taken from the breast for further examination. A biopsy is the removal of tissue from the breast, not the removal of fluid.</p>"
33;SELF_BREAST_BIOPSY_DIAGNOSIS_RISK;RADIO;10;;;9;;Were you told that the diagnosis made on the removed tissue increased your risk of developing breast cancer?;;

35;SELF_ASHKENAZI;RADIO;8;;;9;;Are you of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage?;Why is this relevant?;<p>Ashkenazi Jewish women have a much higher risk of having one of three mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. This is part of the reason why Ashkenazi Jewish women have a much higher-than-average risk of breast cancer. Therefore it is important to capture this information when assessing breast cancer risk.</p>
