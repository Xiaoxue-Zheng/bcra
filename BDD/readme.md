# BCRA BDD

There are two BCRA BDD folders:
 * application - for BDD describing the **application** project
 * questionnaire - for BDD describing the **questionnaire** project

Each BDD feature is stored in a separate **.feature** file.
 
## Gherkin Language

The BDD is written in the [Gherkin Lanaguage](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/).


In future, this could be used to create tests using [Cucumber](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/cucumber-essential-training/).
